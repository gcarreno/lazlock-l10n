# LazLock Translation

LazLock is a password locker that you can find [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazlock/).

The author of LazLock is [Christopher Hawkins](https://twitter.com/CyberFilth).

It's built with [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org).

This is an effort to have it translated and localised.
